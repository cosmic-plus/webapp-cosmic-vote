What's a community, if not a group of people that share a common destiny? And
which better way for being part of such an adventure than taking part in making
weightful decisions?

Cosmic.vote brings in the ring a great tool for that very purpose: Majority Judgment.

### First Thing First

We can trace scientific researches on voting system back to the XIVe century.
The centric questioning have always been the same: what kind voting system can
edge against strategic voting, manipulations & minoritary take-overs?

In other words: which voting rules will reflects the best the common will of a
group of people?

Across years, many "perfect" system have been formalized... Only to crash on the
XXe century mercyless power of synthesis & analysis.

In 1950, Arrow demonstrated that due to some contradicting requirements, an
ideal voting system was impossible to achieve. He concluded that dictature was
the only system to be possibly stable & consistent. However, while doing so, he
left us with a formal description of all noticeable drawbacks a given voting
system may suffer

### Majority Judgment

Taking advantage of that work, X & Y took on themselves to inspect the many
voting systems that have existed in history in order to come up with the best -
while unperfect - applicable solution.

They found one, that they called "Majority Judgement". While simple, this system
is resistant to most manipulations, and have many properties that makes it a
great tool to figure out a group of peer preferences.

How nice that we started this new millenia with a tool that concentrate the best
of social choice theories, yet is simple enough that a child can master its
functionning.
